	<div class="content">Thuja Plicata also commonly known as the Pacific giant red cedar, is commonly found throughout the Pacific Northwest.  
	They are commonly noticed by their large height and wide base sitting around 4 meters wide on average and 70 meters tall.
	They also consist of mostly short scale-like leaves with about a millimeter in length but in sprays of half an inch.
	You can find many cones throughout the tree as small as the leaves in help to repopulate the trees.
	Historical use of the wood has proven to be in the case of basic tools from over eight thousand years ago, but the oldest dated trees have been over 1000 years old.

	<div class="content2">Western Red Cedars can be found all the way south to Northern California and stretch as far north as southern tips of Alaska.
	Most of the tree line ends as east as the Cascade Mountains, and West as the edge of the Pacific Coastline.
	Redcedars are commonly used as shingles and insulation due to their strength, lightness, and durability, and attractive red color.
	They also provide food for a majority of big game in the Pacific Northwest such as for deer.
