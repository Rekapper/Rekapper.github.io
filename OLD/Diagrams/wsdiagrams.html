<h1>Iron Horse Brewery Web Site Diagram Reflection</h1>
<p>
The Iron Horse Brewery’s Web Site follows mostly a hierarchical structure, which shows a consistent 3 layered structure between contents and then categories for each of those key sections.  In the case that they want access for everyone to view what they want immediately the site is structured quite well.  Each element is separated nicely and is quite easy to find without having to use a site search or the bottom navigation which is actually out of date or incomplete compared to the top nav.<br> 
A critical missing element to the design of the structure is that it is not well structured to drive traffic towards either their selling/sales elements, their services such as kegs or their merchandise shop, which is hosted externally.  By not having the linear structure from one end to the other you are not pushing your customers through your shop, on one hand this tends to be a more friendly modern design, but it has been proven that this will result in less traffic through any of their online money making ventures.  Luckily the structure is not entirely random either in the sense that the styling fit many other brewery websites and much like others, they have blog elements and recent events.<br>
One concept or rework that could be performed to redesign the website in a way that it would drive more people into the micropub and the merchandise online shop, would be to have those two elements be the first on the list of tabs at the top.  The second step would be to feature the hours and locations as the main element on the page, part of the header design at the least.  And does the High Five Hefe really need its own separate web page?  If the design is around driving more online traffic for SEO purposes the information should lead you back to their other websites and at least the merch shop, but because of their broken beer finder app and out of date information it really drives people nowhere.<br>
Ultimately the blog should fix any SEO demands they need if they write frequently enough about their own products and cross reference other sites which are responding back to them, but based on the structure of the site, the traffic would be near useless other than to assume it’s a small local friendly brewery rather than their actually quite large operations.  For the fact that the site is hosted entirely through wordpress CMS with a wide range of plugins we can understand that a mixture of their traffic must be designed for consistence of updates and new information on a regular basis compared to a flat html page.  Equally this should help with the page layout and system flow for mobile oriented traffic too.<br>

<h1>420 Loft Building Diagram Reflection</h1>
<p>
A site designed around renting out the rooms seems to have a semi random structure in the sense that every page links to every other heading page and that’s about it for all the content beyond the two sub content portions being the press release page which is accessible only from a small link at the bottom of the about the building page and the rental agreement pdf.  Otherwise almost all of the content is hosted elsewhere like on Flickr.<br>
A goal for them to change up the site structure would be to actually have more content online in the first place, the rental agreement could actually be a web form and they could include a page of dates that the place is rented out or a calendar section to book it for availability.  Equally the Art Gallery could tell you about more information as to what is being currently shown, last I remember hearing a small indie radio station was going to set up shop in the building but that was only in the newspaper, and not even a local one which would suggest that there is not much interest in maintaining this website at all. Equally what hints at this information is the fact that at every change the page tries to redirect you to their Facebook page or their Flickr slideshows.  A second Goal for them could be to design the site as one single page with section breaks and have the main nav setup so that it skips to a later portion on the page as with the simpler design it keeps people on the page for longer than having to reload the header information when that isn’t proper cached in the browser.  What has to be also assumed in this design case, is that the site is more of a template design for other websites either hosted through a specific CMS, or just a raw css+html page and we can find out that information through builtwith.com or just searching through the html source.
