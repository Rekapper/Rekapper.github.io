<h2>Sample Error Messages</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>FATAL ERROR No DOCTYPE specified!</b></dt>
<dd><i>
"I could not parse this document, because it does not include a DOCTYPE Declaration. A DOCTYPE Declaration is mandatory for most current markup languages and without such a declaration it is impossible to validate this document."</i></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>This will occur if you have a typo somewhere in your DOCTYPE statement. You should always copy and paste the DOCTYPE statement from a reliable source!</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><b>Error statement:</b></dt>
<dd><i>"Line 16, column 6: end tag for "head" which is not finished (explain...).
&lt; &frasl; head &gt;"</i></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>You look at your &lt; head &gt; tags and see that they are done correctly....and wonder why is it giving you this message about the head tag. This will occur if you forget to put in a &lt;title&gt; tag in your head section of your page. Even though the omitted &lt;title&gt; tag is the problem, the validator comments on it by saying that the head element isn't finished. That means that it is missing a required element, like the title tag. So, in this case, you would have to look at codes ABOVE the &lt; &frasl; head &gt; tag to find the error.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><b>Error statement:</b></dt>
<dd><i>"Line 15, character "&lt;" is the first character of a delimiter but occurred as data."</i></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>This comment will appear if you forget the closing quote around the value for an attribute. For example, if you have this tag: <b>&lt; ul type="square &gt; </b>When you forget to close the quote after an attribute value, the next element in the page will be an error because the &lt; starts a new code and you can't have a new code until you end the code before it.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><b>Error statement:</b></dt>
<dd><i>"Line 21, column 37: document type does not allow element "h1" here; missing one of "object", "applet", "map", "iframe", "button", "ins", "del" start-tag."</i></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>This comment will appear if you forget the closing slash on a closing tag. For example, if you have this code: <b>&lt;h1&gt;Whatever text you Want&lt;h1&gt;</b>. No code after this will be correct because you need the closing slash in the &lt; &frasl; head &gt; tag to <b>END</b> the code. Usually, if the validator reports that the "document type does not allow element here...", there is a problem with the coding that comes <b>BEFORE</b> the named element.</dd>
