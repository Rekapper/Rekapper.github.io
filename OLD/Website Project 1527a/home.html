	<h4> Shenzhen is my favorite city, and I'd like to share more about it with you:</h4>
	<ul><li><b>Shenzhen</b> is by far one of the most uptempo cities on Earth, every 10 years significant landscape and skyline changes occur so much so that you'd head back to the same area and not recognize a single thing. </li>
	<li>I wanted to share to you some of the brief history of what was originally a coastline fishing city to one of the biggest industrial producers of the <b>East</b>.</li>
	<li>Equally I wanted to share some of the best places to visit and things to do in this huge city.</li></ul>
