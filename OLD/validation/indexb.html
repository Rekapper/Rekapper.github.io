<div><h2><b>Assignment Instructions</b></h2><p>While it may sound simple to validate your HTML code, it is often times difficult to understand the error messages validation services return. Using the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>, validate and correct the errors in each of these five web pages. After saving the files to your computer, review each of them and correct as many errors as you can <b>BEFORE</b> validating. Then, upload each file to the validation service. You will need to locate and correct the errors in each file. Once you have finished:</p> 
<ul>
<li>upload each of the corrected files to Canvas via the <b>Upload File</b> tab</li>
<li>add multiple files by clicking the <b>Add Another File</b> button</li>
</ul>
<b>NOTE:</b> Just because the page may display correctly, does not mean that it is coded correctly.
