	<div class="content1">Review From Rekapper at <a href="http://rekapper.com">rekapper.com</a>: Flying Batteries - Life in Monochrome<br>
	"Flying Batteries once again launches an album of fast flashy electronics from the 80's with the hard driven shoegazy sound of modern beach rock.  While the mixing can be quite the wall of sound at parts, the synth works and the craftsmanship of their works really are showcased in this album.  They highlight the rock and metal section of The Hai along with New Motive Power."

	<div class="content2">Review From Carpelux at <a href="http://inb4track.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/best-of-mu-contest-vol-2/">inb4track</a>: Flying Batteries – Tonight<br>

"One of the best bands on /mu/, and a member of The Hai, a group many of the best acts who used to frequent the board around a year ago have joined. The first track I heard from them, when they were still called Cold Haze, is still one of the best pop tracks I’ve seen come out of this whole mess.

“Tonight” is a charming track, as usual playful with the whole 8-bit synth style. It’s catchy in it’s own way and just cool in general."</div>
