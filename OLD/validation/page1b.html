<div><h2><b>About Validation</b></h2><p>The validator is similar to a spell-checker - it will find coding syntax errors but <b>NOT</b> all of your errors. For example, the validator does not check for browser compatibility (more on this later in the quarter), nor does it spell-check your text. It also will not check if your work follows the instructions for the assignment!</p>
<p>For future assignments, you will be <b>REQUIRED</b> to validate your code, and the files must pass validation in order to receive credit and feedback. It will also be important for you to become very familiar with the validation process and deciphering error messages before you get into more complex code.</p></div>
