<h1>History of Shenzhen:</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Shenzhen's Name Origin?</dt>
<dd>Shenzhen's origins are based around 1400's with the name meaning opening of a snakes mouth implying that the Pearl River opens up to the ocean through Shenzhen.</dd>
<dt>Brief History</dt>
<dd>Shenzhen back in Han Dynasty was know for their salt fields and spices based on their great sea and land based location.  As a result of this, when many other civilizations and empires later landed there, it became a strategic defence and trading center.</dd>
<dt>Modern History</dt>
<dd>It wasn't until the 1979 when Shenzhen suddenly became an industrial hotspot and business hotspot mostly to blame on the factor that Hong Kong is right next door.  This results in China stating it to become on of the first five SEZ (Special Economic Zones) which had restrictions as to entering the area especially if you were Chinese. </dd>
